# Raspberry Pi Tracker Configuration - Motion-Optimized Headless Mode

# Server connection
server:
  # Production server (default for RPi)
  url: "https://officeserver-production.up.railway.app"
  # Local development server (use with --debug flag)
  # Use your Mac's IP address, not localhost (localhost on RPi = RPi itself, not Mac)
  local_url: "http://10.1.10.42:8000"
  rpi_id: "default"
  heartbeat_interval: 30  # Seconds between heartbeats
  command_poll_interval: 5  # Seconds between command checks (reduced frequency to avoid overwhelming dashboard)

# Camera settings
camera:
  width: 2304
  height: 1296
  fps: 30  # High capture FPS for quality
  stream_fps: 2  # FPS for dashboard streaming (reduced to prevent overwhelming server connections)
  stream_quality: 50  # JPEG quality for streaming (0-100, lower = smaller files)
  
# Detection settings
detection:
  scale: 0.25  # Heavy downscale for YOLO (576x324 detection size)
  confidence: 0.5
  check_interval: 1.0  # Check every 1 second only (legacy - kept for compatibility)
  motion_check_interval: 1.0  # NEW - Motion detection interval (recommended: 0.5-2.0)
                               # 0.5 = More responsive, catches fast movement
                               # 1.0 = Balanced (recommended)
                               # 2.0 = Ultra low power, might miss fast movement

# Tripwires (managed by server, but stored locally as fallback)
tripwires:
  outer_x: 800
  inner_x: 1800

# Capture settings
capture:
  burst_size: 10  # Number of images per burst
  burst_interval: 0.2  # 200ms between captures
  event_cooldown: 3.0  # 3s before next event
